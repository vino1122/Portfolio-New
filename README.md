Portfolio - Vinojani Gajendran

This is a simple personal portfolio site built with HTML and CSS.

Animations added (Dec 2025):
- Subtle animated background gradient overlay
- Fade/slide reveal animations for sections and images (uses IntersectionObserver)
- Custom cursor that follows the mouse and grows on hover
- Animated scroll arrow prompt with float/bounce
- Improved button hover/press micro-interactions and project card glow

To tweak animations, edit `main.css` (look for the "Additional UI Animations" block at the end of the file).

Enjoy — open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
